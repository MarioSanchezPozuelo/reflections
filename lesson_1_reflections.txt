How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    A file can be quite large. Locating the changes may give us a clue of which is the bug. The unaltered parts are not useful for that. Its a waste look all over the file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Doing so you can have a vision of the path along wich the file have changed and hep us shorten this path in the future anticipating errors.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    If you commit too frequently the history will be bigger and difficult to navigate if you commit too late it will be more difficult to understand changes and find bugs. But manual commit alow us to keep commits logically dimensioned.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Cause GIT cares about the relations between the files but in other systems file are considered independent

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    We can locate a commit in the git history using git log, then use git diff to see the changes between this commit ant the previous one

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Cause it allow me to go back to the previous state prior to the changes that broke the code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use it to control versions of my code
